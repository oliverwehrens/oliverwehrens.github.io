      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your IDE does a great job in helping you to program. This includes advanced features like Refactoring, Code completion and support for nifty frameworks. But it can do much more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of the time you actually read the code instead writing it. So how about to make this a bit more pleasant experience (well it was for me at least). Most of the people I see use the standard color scheme of the IDE.  I was using it for way to long, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure. Ever since I tweaked it just a little bit I do find my way around an editor window much more easily.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
