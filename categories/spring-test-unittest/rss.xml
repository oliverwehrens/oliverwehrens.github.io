      <description>&lt;p&gt;You use Spring in  your application everywhere. You love it. Everything gets injected and is configured by Spring. Great. Why not use the same technology to wire up your tests?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is: Starting the Spring Context all the time in your tests drags you down at the costs of development time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is why:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Turnaround times are much faster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you discover a bug which might have not been covered by tests yet (this happens to me all the time) you are much faster rerunning your tests without the application context. In the application I&amp;rsquo;m working on it takes about 20-25 seconds to run a test with application context, whereas a pure unit test just takes 1 second. Now imagine this: changing some code and rerunning tests like 100 times saves you a lot of time. The &lt;strong&gt;tests run faster&lt;/strong&gt;, you &lt;strong&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t get distracted&lt;/strong&gt; because you could do something else in those 20-25 seconds, like browsing some web pages (you want to be efficient and use the &amp;lsquo;spare&amp;rsquo; time to read up the newest stories on infoq.com). But then you need to switch windows, read something, switch back, wonder what you did, rethink the problem and so on. In the end it costs you much more time than it  seems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
