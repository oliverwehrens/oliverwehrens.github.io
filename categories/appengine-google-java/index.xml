      <description>At Campfire One Google announced their App Engine for Java (this was in the rumor mill for a couple of days already). The first 10,000 developers would get an early look at App Engine&#39;s Java language support. I would have almost missed it. Some tweets reminded me of registering with Google. I heard of AppEngine before but the fact that it was only available for Python did not make it very attractive to me.</description>
