      <description>What is Extreme visibility?&#xA;Extreme visibility is all about providing information about the code to every team in near real time. We show several metrics such as complexity of the code (xs), todo&amp;rsquo;s, deprecated methods, number of broken builds, open tickets and their priority and so on. These are distributed over a couple of screens which our software is rotating through. Every team member can easily see if his or her commits effecting the code quality in a good or bad way and makes the members aware of certain quality standards we try to keep in our code base.</description>
