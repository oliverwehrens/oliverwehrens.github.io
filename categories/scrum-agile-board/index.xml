      <description>So just in the last sprint we (re) discovered that we need an owner of each story. A person who makes sure things are going smoothly and takes care that everything is done in a way so we can fulfill all acceptance tests. At sprint start the person which feels the strongest about the first story will be owner and he will drive the story. Very often we do operate in a king and servant model.</description>
