      <description>&lt;p&gt;No matter how good  a developer is, with two hardware upgrades you can speed up most machines and cut down development time for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;your-big-fat-ide&#34;&gt;Your big fat IDE&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depending what you use to crunch out your code, these things are eating your memory. And then you have your application server running, and an internet browser with 20+ sessions, plus Twitter, plus Photoshop, plus, plus, plus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I used to have 2 GB RAM in my laptop and I thought it is ok. Turns out, having 4 GB,  speeds up my overall development significantly. No more swapping of programs and more programs can stay open. So far I never reached the point where my memory was exhausted (well I never really tried).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
