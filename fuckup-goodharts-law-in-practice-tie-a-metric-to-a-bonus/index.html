  <section><p>It might be a familiar situation to you:
You have an increasing code base 📈, teams are growing and your ability to deploy is deteriorating 🚨.</p>
<p>What do you do? How can you make sure all developers and product owners take care of quality?</p>
<p>In order to react to changes and fix bugs we wanted to be able to roll out fixes as fast as possible (that was
in ~2014). One prerequisite for this was a that all build pipelines for the main branch are green 🟢.</p>
<p>So we set the goal, that at the end of the day, on average all (main) build pipelines must be green
(implicating deployable) at 95% rate. We tied part of the yearly 📅 bonus 🤑 on that.</p>
<p>At the time it sounded like a good idea 👍, and we had a company goal for everyone. We had dashboards at the coffee machine,
everybody could see the progress.</p>
<p><strong>We had no idea</strong></p>
<p>1️⃣ We did not know about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart&rsquo;s Law:</a> 👩🏻‍💼. It says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2️⃣ People like to <del>game</del> win against the system 🏆</p>
<p><strong>What happened</strong></p>
<p>Some developers created build pipelines, which did nothing besides being green 🤷🏻‍. If it was not enough, they had
one pipeline which created other green pipelines and deleted them afterward.</p>
<p>I got to know this practice a few weeks before the official end of the bonus period. I was responsible for that
goal. I saw that I fucked up 🤦. Good intentions. Wrong outcome. At this point, I got to know Charles Goodhart.</p>
<p><strong>What did I learn</strong></p>
<p>I will ❌ never ❌ tie such a metric to a financial outcome 💰 again. We could still have the goal, just not tied to money.
Instead, talk to everyone and understand why their build is broken and try to remove 🚚 what is blocking them.</p>
