<p>A couple of things are very easy and provided me with great value.

<ul>
	<li>Give your method names a color, this will make it very explicit that something else is called here.</li>
<li>In most IDE you colorize variables with read/write access if you select them. Choose bright colors so you can easily grasp where this variable is used.</li>
<li>Magic number/strings are usually not desired. Make those very ugly to look at so you really want to get rid of them.
</li>
</ul>

Several people like to have big fonts for coding. If less text fits on one screen without scrolling you are likely to code smaller methods/classes. I&rsquo;m not so sure about that one I just find it aesthetically not very pleasing.</p>
