</ul>
<h2 id="what-i-value">What I Value</h2>
<p><strong>People</strong>: Happy people create great products, which lead to happy customers.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong>: The only real failure is not learning from our mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Communication</strong>: Say what you mean, ask what you need—no need for fluff. I’m German, so I keep it as direct as you can.</p>
<p><strong>Actions Over Words</strong>: Talk alone doesn’t get things done—actions do.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership Everywhere</strong>: Leadership is about guiding and supporting others, not titles or tenure. I lead from behind as a servant lead.</p>
<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>
<p><strong>You&rsquo;re great at what you do.</strong> You wouldn&rsquo;t be here otherwise. If I ask a lot of questions, it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m curious—I like to understand how things work. I taught myself programming at 12 just to figure out how computers operate, and that curiosity never left me.</p>
<p><strong>You&rsquo;ll tell me if something&rsquo;s blocking you.</strong> My job is to set you up for success. Sometimes things fall through the cracks, and I might not realize I’m letting you down unless you tell me.</p>
<p><strong>You feel safe challenging me.</strong> I believe the best ideas come from being examined from all angles. I welcome debate and enjoy being challenged.</p>
<h2 id="availability--communication">Availability &amp; Communication</h2>
<p>Whether in person or remote, my preferred method of communication is what works best for you.</p>
<p>Feel free to drop time on my calendar, it is up to date and the openings are for the taking.</p>
<p>If there is not time, reach out and I&rsquo;ll make some. If it matters to you it matters to me.</p>
<p>If its an emergency make sure to let me know immediately!</p>
<p><strong>Meetings</strong> A meeting without a clear agenda or purpose drains my energy—I’m guessing it does the same for you. If the goal isn’t clear, ask or just decline.</p>
<p><strong>1:1s</strong> These are sacred. It’s your time to discuss what matters to you, not just a status update (unless that’s what you want). If I have to reschedule, I’ll do my best to make sure we still meet that week.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-you-help-me">How can you help me?</h2>
<p><strong>Be a great teammate.</strong>  Celebrate wins together, be honest and open—we all grow from it.</p>
<p><strong>Do Amazing Work.</strong> This is the expectation. Let me know if there is something keeping you from accomplishing this.</p>
<p><strong>Disagree with me.</strong> Good solutions come from healthy debate, we need to be comfortable separating ideas and egos.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me if I screw up.</strong> I’m not perfect, and I don’t pretend to be. If I make a mistake and don’t see it, tell me.</p>
<h3 id="things-i-struggle-with">Things I struggle with</h3>
<p><strong>Asking for help</strong>. It’s not my strong suit.</p>
<p><strong>Imposter syndrom</strong>. I often feel like I don’t know enough.</p>
<p><strong>Patience</strong>. Slow progress can frustrate me.</p>
<p>If you notice any of this, call it out—I want to improve.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-work">How I work</h2>
<p><strong>Own it.</strong> – I take full responsibility for what I do, from idea to impact. I am accountable.</p>
<p><strong>Make it matter.</strong> – Every action should create real value. If it doesn’t help the customer, the team, or the business, I rethink it.</p>
<p><strong>Improve relentlessly.</strong> – Good enough isn’t good enough. I learn, challenge myself and others, and raise the bar continuously.</p>
<p><strong>Decisions.</strong> – I make my decisions based on the data at hand. I’ll ensure more data is available. In the end, I decide.</p>
<p><strong>Disagree and commit.</strong> –  I may not always agree with our decision, but once it’s made, I commit to it.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-do-when-im-not-working">What do I do when I&rsquo;m not working</h2>
<ul>
<li>Home Automation, don&rsquo;t get me started &hellip;</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m a backend coder by heart</li>
<li>Garden work and wood working</li>
<li>Reading &amp; Podcasts</li>
<li>SciFi &amp; Marvel Movies</li>
<li>Traveling places</li>
