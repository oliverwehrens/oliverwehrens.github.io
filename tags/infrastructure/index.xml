      <description>In Response to Matt Raible&#39;s question about my preferred development stack. Source control In my own development project I switched to Git some time ago. I was using svn and before that cvs for a couple of years. Git just makes it easy to try out small ideas very quickly without reverting the code. We will introduce Git at work pretty soon (I hope).&#xA;The Atlassian cloud I was using Confluence as a Wiki in my open source project and my current employer Hypoport uses it as well.</description>
