      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to try AI for software development. The last time I tried it was with Github Copilot in 2023, and I was thrilled. It was great. It could predict my next code, could almost read my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2025, new tools were coming up. I decided to give cursor.com a try. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve been a podcast listener for years, I choose to program a podcast app. I&amp;rsquo;ve never done anything in iOS or Swift before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
