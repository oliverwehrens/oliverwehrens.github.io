      <description>&lt;p&gt;It might be a familiar situation to you:&#xA;You have an increasing code base ðŸ“ˆ, teams are growing and your ability to deploy is deteriorating ðŸš¨.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do you do? How can you make sure all developers and product owners take care of quality?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to react to changes and fix bugs we wanted to be able to roll out fixes as fast as possible (that was&#xA;in ~2014).

We were a Java Shop&#xA;with an occasional Groovy service. All JVM based. One team decided that they wanted to try&#xA;out something new and went for Scala. It was cool, new features, functional, less boilerplate. It was hype.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
