      <description>Lots of things have changed for me in 2019. So letâ€™s look back.&#xA;In 2019, the biggest project I was ever involved in and responsible for went live. Nothing happened at launch day and everything started to work smoothly. We worked the whole of 2018 with up to 10 teams on this project. That was a very cool experience. Thanks to everybody who was involved. It would not have been possible without all of you.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of Simon Wardley&amp;rsquo;s Maps.&#xA;Ben Mosior over at Miro came up with a nice canvas for Wardley mapping. I could not find a vector version for printing out, so I made one with Affinity Designer.&#xA;They are available at my Github Repository. It contains the original .afdesign file as well as a PDF version with and without explanation.</description>
