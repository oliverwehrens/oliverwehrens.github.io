      <description>It all started when my new boss stepped into my door and asked me if I had a clue how our system was working. In an ideal world we would have teams and developers who work on a isolated context with clear boundaries. They develop, test, deploy, monitor and operate everything by themselves. They are on 24/7 call and therefore they do everything possible that nothing fails. The system is stable and brings in the money.</description>
