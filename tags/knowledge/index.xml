      <description>Over the time I developed my own way of remembering what the content of a book was. I&amp;rsquo;m reading a lot self improvement, time management, management and culture books. A trainer once told me if I could remember months later only 10% what was in the book I&amp;rsquo;m really good. I wanted to change that.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m reading mostly on my Kindle. I have all the books always with me. The nice thing about it is, that I could mark text which is important or useful to me.</description>
