      <description>I got asked on LinkedIn, so here is my answer.&#xA;It depends (on the phase of the company).&#xA;I like Simon Wardley&amp;rsquo;s Mapping. He defines categories of company phases&#xA;Pioneers (searching for Product-Market Fit) Settlers (might have found Product-Market Fit) Town planners (Found something to grow) A job in an early startup is very different from a big corporation. I also assume that while going through the phases, the company grows.</description>

      <description>On March 12th we decided to send everybody into Home office. We were partially already working remotely but we never tried to be 100%. Now we were forced to.&#xA;As a summary: It works better than I expected. The remote work is not as much as a problem for everybody. Being stuck at home is.&#xA;Tools (donâ€™t fix problems) We already had bits and pieces in place to enable remote collaboration.</description>
