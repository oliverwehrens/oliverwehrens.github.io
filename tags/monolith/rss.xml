      <description>This is my talk about Development of distributed systems - challenges not only for the architecture. You guessed it, it is in german. I gave this talk at BedCon 2015 and I will talk about it again at the Architecture Gathering 2015 in Munich on October 22nd. Abstract:&#xA;Jede Platform wächst mit der Zeit. Mehr Entwickler mit noch mehr Ideen und Vorstellungen arbeiten alle gemeinsam an der Weiterentwicklung. Das System wird größer und auf viele Systeme verteilt.</description>

      <description>If you start, a monolith is much easier to begin with. Everything is in one place, it&amp;rsquo;s fast and all team members understand the code. If you plan your application from the start as distributed system in a microservice like style, you add some significant overhead. Don&amp;rsquo;t do it, monoliths have their advantages at some point. If another team start with the same project or more functionality is added, splitting up the monolith might be a way to go.</description>

      <description>You planned your software. You talked to your business owners. As soon as you saw a new use case which should be implemented, you modularized it. You did everything right. And then you hit the integration layer. Sounds familiar?&#xA;At some point in your project you need to integrate all modules with each other. In case of a website you need to produce HTML.&#xA;There are different approaches how to tackle this problem.</description>

      <description>Everybody says monolithic applications are bad. I usually hear things like:&#xA;Tiny changes need full redeployment (maybe even with downtime) Limited agility Easy to get a big ball of mud So why would you like to have a monolith?&#xA;There are many definitions of a monolithic application. There are tons for microservices.&#xA;A Monolith has it&amp;rsquo;s advantages. There are companies which are successful with monolithic applications.&#xA;You start faster. It&amp;rsquo;s one codebase.</description>

      <description>You start your green field project and keep working on it. It grows and grows and grows. You feel comfortable with it and it could not be better. Because more needs to be done/the product is successful another team is added.&#xA;If this new team starts complaining that the setup if very complicated and they do take a lot of time to get started: Listen carefully. Of course everybody will complain if they get thrown into another code base, nobody understands the code and of course everybody would have it done differently.</description>
