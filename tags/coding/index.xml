      <description>2008 Robert C. Martin published his book &amp;lsquo;Clean Code&amp;rsquo;. I was just starting my new job as Senior Software Developer at Hypoport. It was eye-opening. We discussed it in a tech department wide book circle, exchanged ideas of what things mean and agreed to some standards which are important to us.&#xA;Over the years, I learned that people took that as the bible. And it went further. My favourite example of taking it religiously is: Don&amp;rsquo;t repeat yourself (DRY).</description>
