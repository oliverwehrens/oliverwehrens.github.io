      <description>We are agile. We do Scrum. We do daily Stand-ups.&#xA;A couple of weeks ago we changed our daily stand-up meeting. Our Scrum master came up with the idea to not go around the whole team and everybody talks about what he has done, what he will do and what the impediments are but to make it story based.&#xA;Usually after a break down everybody was working on one story, saw the task cards and made sure he did the things he was supposed to do.</description>
